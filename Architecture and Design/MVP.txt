MVP pattern:

->Model view presenter pattern
        ->developed from the MVC pattern
        ->here the controller is renamed to presenter
        ->Here the view and the model are neatly separated (actually they don't know each other)
        ->Presenter works as intermediate between Model and View
        ->It binds the view with the model

->Actual Architecture:
       ->View -><- Presenter -><- Model

->In the following diagram a couple of blocks are added as interfaces through which the presenter will interact
       ->View -> IView(Interface) <- Presenter -> IModel(Interface) ->Model
