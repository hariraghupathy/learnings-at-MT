Dependency Property: (link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gurkQr80Xfo)
  What is a dependency property:
    ->Suppose you take a text box -> its name, width , height etc are their dependency properties
    ->They are on top of a normal property and they do have additional features
    ->In a normal property, we can bind a value  
    ->whereas in a dependency property , it can notify when there is a change in the value,we can set default values, we can do some validations on it
    ->It is a way of binding

Creating a dependency property:
   ->prop is used to create a normal property
   ->propdp is used to create a dependency property
   ->after typing propdp we have to tab twice to insert the dependency property
  

Register Method Parameters:
   ->First is the property name
   ->second is the type of parameter
   ->third parameter corresponds to which class it belongs ->so it is userControl1

->Why it is used:
   ->Like Name,width,height, the one which we create is also a dependency property
