Attached Dependncy Property:

Where did i use?
->To bind the close event of the window and handle it in the view model

How?

->Create an interface with the following properties:

Window MyWindow {get;set;}

void OnClosed(object sender,EventArgs e);

->Then implement the interface in the ViewModel where we want to handle the close event of the window

->Create a class which contains the attached dependency property : 
 ->propa
 ->Let it be a boolean property
 ->then inside PropertyMetaData ->pass the default value as false and then pass this method "OnPropertyChanged"
   new PropertyMetadata(false,OnPropertyChanged) 

->Then in the main xaml bind the dependency property as follows

 VM:AutoBindEvents.IsAutoBindEvent="True"

->When the boolean value is set as true, when the window closes, the OnPropertyChanged will be invoked
