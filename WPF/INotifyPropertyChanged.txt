INotifyPropertyChanged: (link:https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/use-inotifypropertychanged-interface-in-wpf-mvvm/)
         ->INotifyPropertyChanged is an interface member in System.ComponentModel Namespace.
         ->This interface is used to notify the control that the property value has changed
        
Implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface:

Scenario:
  ->Consider two properties First Name and Last Name
  ->When we update these properties programmatically,it updates the UI automatically

NotifyPropertyChanged:
  ->Create one class NotifyPropertyChanged to implement the INotifyPropertyChanged interface from System.Component Model
  ->It should implement the IPropertyChanged event 
  ->Then create a method to raise the property chage event to notify the UI
  ->Now inherit the NotifyPropertyChanged class to the User class to use the members to raise property change notification

->We have to use namespace for viewmodel in the windows xaml file

    ->xmlns:vm="clr-namespace:NotifyCommand.ViewModel"

->DataContext:
   ->Data Context property will be assigned to the view model
