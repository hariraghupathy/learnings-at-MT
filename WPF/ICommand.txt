ICommand:(https://www.codeproject.com/articles/1052346/%2fArticles%2f1052346%2fICommand-Interface-in-WPF)
   ->To bind a command to a button, we have to implement the ICommand Interface
   ->ICommand is composed by:
          ->event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged;     
          ->bool CanExecute(object parameter);     
          ->void Execute(object parameter);  
    ->Can Execute:
          ->It will define whether the command can be executed or not
          ->If it returns false, the button will be disabled
    ->Execute:
          ->It runs the command logic
    ->CanExecuteChanged: 
          ->
