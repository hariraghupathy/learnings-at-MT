DataBinding: (link:https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/29054/WPF-Data-Binding-Part)
  ->DataBinding is a mechanism in WPF applications that provides a simple way for windows forms applications to interact with data
  ->Only by using this we can have the MVVM architecture implemented
  ->It allows the flow of data between the UI elements and the data objects on the user interface
  ->Changes in the UI automatically updates the model and any change in the model can be reflected to the corresponding UI element
  
Two Types of Data Binding:
  ->One way data binding 
  ->Two way data binding

->One-way data binding copies the value from the source object and automatically updates the destination object 

->Two way data binding: both will work -> from source to destination and from destination to source , both will work good
    
->Dependency Property:
  ->data binding copies value from the source object to the destination object
  ->since the destination object depends upon the source object, it is said to be a dependency property

Binding Properties along with their description:
  ->Property  : Description

  ->Converter:sets the converter to be used
  ->Element Name:Name of the element to which the binding is to be made
  ->Fallback Value:Sets the value to use when binding cannot return a value
  ->Mode:Sets the direction of the binding
  ->Path:The path to the element property being used as the data source
  ->RelativeSource:Sets the binding source by specifying an element relative to the current element
  ->Source:The source object to use for binding.
  ->StringFormat:Specifies the format of the string representation of a value if the element is bound to a string property
  ->UpdateSourceTrigger:Sets the events on which binding will occur
  ->Validation Rules:A collection of the validation rules applied against a binding



Binding Modes:
1.One Way:From source to destination
2.TwoWay:Changes to source and destination are copied to each other,we have to use UpdateSourceTrigger
3.OneWayToSource:reverse of one way
4.One Time:The property is initially set, but updates to the source are not copied to the destination

->UpdateSourceTrigger:
   ->Two way data binding depends upon this property
   ->It will depend on when to update the source
   ->UpdateSourceTrigger=OnPropertyChanged

->Controlling when binding occurs:
   ->Default
   ->Explicit
   ->LostFocus
   ->PropertyChanged
