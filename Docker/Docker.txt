Docker for Developers:

->Building and deploying new applications is faster with containers
->Docker containers wraps up software and its dependencies into a standardized unit 
->This unit includes everything it needs to run: code,runtime,system tools and libraries

Advantages:

->Onboard faster and stop wasting hours trying to set up development environments
->spin up new instances and make copies of production code to run locally
->Polygot Programming:
 ->It is the practice of writing code in multiple languages to capture additional functionality and efficiency
   not available in a single language
->So docker helps to enable polygot development and use any language,stack or tools without worry of application conflicts
->it alleviates concern over application security
