1.Functional dependency:


->It is a relationship that exists when one attribute uniquely determines another attribute
   ->attributes are fields preent in a table
   ->If R is a relation(table) with two attributes(columns) X & Y
   ->then -> X->Y
          ->so Y is functionally dependent on X
          ->and X uniquely determines Y
  ->It is a set of constraints bw 2 attributes in a relation
          ->X->Y  where X is DETERMINANT and Y is DEPENDENT
          ->Determinant means X determines the value of Y
          ->dependent means Y is dependent on X



->Sample Table:

  Name  Roll    CGPA
  A     R1      7.5
  B	R2	8.0
  C	R3	9.2
  A	R4	6.5
  B	R5	7.2

Example: 
->In the above relation, if we are asked to find out the CGPA of A, there are two A's which leads to ambiguity
->we have to have something which will uniquely identify the other attribute
->Now if we ask what is the CGPA of Roll number R2,then we can determine the CGPA
->so cgpa can be identified with the help of roll number
->roll number can also determine A
->So functional dependencies in the above table are:

{Roll -> Name , Roll -> CGPA}


2.Fully functional dependency and Partial functional dependency:

Fully functional dependency:(if subset can determine the dependent)

Example:

-> ABC -> D
->So D is functionally dependent on ABC , where A,B and C are individual columns

->When D is fully functionally dependent on ABC?
  ->When no subset of ABC determines D i.e in the below scenarios
     1.AC does not determine D
     2.BC does not determine D
     3.AC does not determine D
     4.A does not determine D
     5.B does not determine D
     6.C does not determine D
  ->only if the above conditions are satisfied and if all A,B and C combines together can determine D, then D is fully functionally dependent on ABC

3.Partial functional dependency:(if subset cannot determine the dependent)

Example 2:
   ->Consider the following dependencies:
   1.AC->P
   2.A->D
   3.D->P
   ->In the above example, P is not fully functionally dependent on AC because:
   ->the relation A->D->P exists, so without C; P can be determined by A
   ->So the above functional dependency AC->P does not exist
   ->but we can say P is partially functionally dependent on AC because without C also we can determine the P from A



4.Transitive Functional Dependency:
   ->There is a transitive functional dependency between functional dependency
   ->Example:
     1.X->Y
     2.Y->Z
     The above two dependencies indicate that X->Z , which implies Z is transitively dependent on X
