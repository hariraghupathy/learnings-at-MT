WCF architecture:
   ->Layered architecture that supports a lot of distributed application development
   ->There are 4 major layers that provide the developers a new service-oriented programming model

1.Contracts
2.Service RunTime
3.Messaging
4.Activation and Hosting

Contracts:
  ->WCF contracts are much like contracts that you and i would sign in real life
  ->This contract or WCF information contains information such as what a service does and the type of information that it will make available
  ->It is a collection of operations that specifies what the endpoint communicates to the outside world
  ->Four types of contracts:
        1.Data Contract: 
              ->It will stipulate or demand or specify the type of data that the WCF service will exchange
        2.Message Contract:
              ->It controls the SOAP messages sent and received by the service
        3.Service Contract:
              ->It inforrms the clients what the endpoint will offer to the outside world
        4.Operation Contract:
              ->Includes the individual API's of the WCF service
        5.Policy and Binding Contracts:
              ->It specifies important information such as security,protocol and other information

Service Runtime:
   ->This manages the behaviours of the service that occurs during service operation
   ->Various behaviours managed by the service runtime layer:
        1.Throttling Behaviour:
             ->It defines the number of processed images
        2.Error Behaviour:
             ->It specifies what action should be taken if an error occurs during the service runtime
        3.MetaData Behaviour:
             ->Controls or not whether the metadata has to be exposed to the outside world(wsdl for clients)
        4.Instance Behaviour:
             ->It drives how many instances of the service will be available to process messages
        5.Message Inspection:
             ->Gives the service the ability to inspect all parts of the message
        6.Transaction Behaviour:
             ->It provides the ability to rollback the transaction if a process fails during the service runtime
        7.Dispatch Behaviour:
             ->Service determines how the message should be handled and processed
        8.Concurrency Behaviour:
             ->It defines how each service or instance of the service handles threading
        9.Parameter Filtering:
             ->Filters the message headers and executes preset actions based on the filter of the message headers


Messaging:
    ->This layer defines what formats and data exchange patterns can be used during service communication
    ->List of channels and components that the messaging leayer is composed of :
        1.WS Security Channel:
             ->It implements the WS-Security specification,which enables message security
        2.WS Reliable Message Channel:
             ->It provides guarenteed message delivery
        3.Encoders:
             ->It lets us pick a number of encodings for the message
        4.HTTP Channel:
             ->It tells the service that the message delivery will take place via the HTTP protocol
        5.TCP Channel:
             ->It tells the service that the message delivery will take place via the TCP protocol
        6.Transaction Flow Channel:
             ->It governs transacted message patterns
        7.NamedPipe Channel:
             ->It enables inter-process communication
        8.MSMQ channel:
             ->It helps to use MSMQ (Microsoft Message Queuing)


Activation and Hosting:
      ->These provide various options in which a service can be started as well as hosted
      ->Services can be hosted within the context of another application or can be self-hosted
      ->The hosting and activation points provided by this layer are:
         1.Windows Activation Service:
               ->It enables WCF applications to be automatically started when running on a computer that is running windows activation service
         2..EXE:
               ->WCF allows services to be run as executables
         3.Windows Services:
               ->WCF allows services to be hosted through windows services
         4.COM+:
               ->WCF allows services to be run as COM+ application


Summary:
      ->So WCF architecture mainly has four layers:
            1.Contracts
            2.Service RunTime
            3.Messaging
            4.Activation and Hosting
