security modes in WCF:

1.Message Security Mode:
   ->In this mode,the message will be encrypted and passed over a non-secure channel so that no one can read it

2.Transport Security Mode:
   ->the communication channel will be encrypted and also provides integrity,privacy and so on

3.Mixed Transfer Security Mode:
   ->This mode provides transport security for message privacy and it uses message security for secure credentials

4.Both security mode:
   ->This mode uses both message and transport security.So the message will be encrypted using message 
     security and will be passed over a secure channel using transport security.
   ->It provides more security than others, but it degrades performance


Authentications in WCF:
  
    ->In wcf , authentication process verifies the caller and checks whether they are authorized
    or not to get access to the service
   
1.Windows Authentication:
     ->In this mode,the caller must provide his/her Windows credential for authentication

2.UserName/Password:
     ->In this mode the caller must provide username and password for authentication

3.X509 certificates:
     ->In this mode,the caller must send certificate information and the service will 
       check whether the service is valid or not

4.Custom Mechanism:
     ->In this mode, the user must use their own protocol and credentials type instead
     of built-in authentication

5.Issue Token:
     ->In this mode,both the caller and the service rely on a secure token service to issue the client 
     a token for service identity.It uses a windows card space

6.No authentication:
     ->WCF does not implement any authentication in this mode


wshttpbinding and nettcpbinding provides windows authentication
