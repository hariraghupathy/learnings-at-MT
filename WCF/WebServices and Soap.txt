WebServices:
  ->Why do we need webservices?
      ->Web Services allow us to expose our functionalities over the network such that 
        other systems including our client systems can gain access of our functionalities
      ->Example: ExtractKeyFields API

  ->Formats used for communication:
      ->SOAP  
      ->REST

  ->SOAP:
      ->XML based communication
      ->supports protocols other than HTTP
      ->This can be used when we have multiple clients and when they have different protocols for communication
      ->more secure
 
  ->REST:(caching)
      ->communication is by json
      ->most browsers use REST
      ->It supports only HTTP protocol
      ->This is used when the number of hits to a URL is very high
      ->it does caching

  ->WCF:
     ->It follows SOAP
     ->It can be made REST also
     ->Runs only in Windows(.NET Framework)
  ->WebAPI:
     ->It follows REST
     ->It can be made both SOAP and REST
     ->Runs in both Windows and Linux(.NET core)
