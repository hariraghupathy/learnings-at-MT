Unsafe:
  ->c# allows pointer variables to be used in a function of a code block when it is marked by the unsafe modifier
  ->The unsafe code or the unmanaged code is a code block that uses a pointer variable.
  ->If we are using unsafe code, we have to enable Allow unsafe code in our Visual Studio
  ->Example:
       unsafe {
            int var = 20;
            int* p = &var;
            
            Console.WriteLine("Data is: {0} " , var);
            Console.WriteLine("Data is: {0} " , p->ToString());
            Console.WriteLine("Address is: {0} " , (int)p);
         }
