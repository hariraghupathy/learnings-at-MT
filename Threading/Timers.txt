Timers
    ->The timer control allows us to specify a particular interval of time at which an event has to occur
    ->It is useful when we want execute certain applications after a particular interval
    ->Example:
       ->Suppose we want to make an hourly backup of our data
       ->We can program a routine with Timer such that it backsup the data every hour
       ->we set the timer's interval for an hour
    ->Implementation:
       ->Create a windows form with two buttons start and stop
       ->In this application,we are going to create a file on the start event such that every 5 seconds we are going to write the time to the text file
       ->Also create a timer and give the interval property to 5000 (5 seconds)
       ->On the tick event of the timer , write the functionality i.e what should happen
       ->The start button will set the timer's enabled property to true
       ->The stop button will set the timer's enabled property to false
       
->Code:


namespace Timers
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        private static FileStream objFileStream=new FileStream(@"C:\Users\vr-1\Desktop\Hari Krishnan\Temp Files\timer.txt",FileMode.OpenOrCreate,FileAccess.Write);
        private static StreamWriter objStreamWriter = new StreamWriter(objFileStream);
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            objStreamWriter.WriteLine("{0} {1}",
   DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString(), DateTime.Now.ToLongDateString());
            objStreamWriter.Flush();
        }

        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Write to the file using StreamWriter class  
            objStreamWriter.BaseStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.End);
            objStreamWriter.Write(" File Write Operation Starts : ");
            objStreamWriter.WriteLine("{0} {1}",
            DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString(), DateTime.Now.ToLongDateString());
            objStreamWriter.WriteLine("===================================== \n");
            objStreamWriter.Flush();
        }

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            timer1.Enabled = true;
        }

        private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            timer1.Enabled = false;
        }
    }
}
