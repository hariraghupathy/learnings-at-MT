Why we use get/set/value?
  ->Exposing a field as public gets risky
  ->we don't know what will be assigned to the field
  ->Example:
           -> Class Program
              {
                int _iAge;
                public int Age
                {
                   get
                   {
                       return _iAge;
                   }
                   set
                   {
                       _iAge=value;
                   }
                }
              }
