PLinq:
  ->Parallel Linq is similar to the TPL whereit helps us to query the collections concurrently based on the capabilities of the host computer
  ->AsParallel() method is used to acheive parallel programming
  ->var queryA = from num in numberList.AsParallel()
                 select ExpensiveFunction(num) //good for PLINQ
  ->var queryB = from num in numberList.AsParallel()
                 where num%2==0
                 select num //not good for PLINQ

  ->AsOrdered():
     ->PLinq provides the AsOrdered operator for situations in which it is necessary to maintain the order of elements in the source sequence
     ->PLINQ performs best when it is allowed to process elements in the source collection in any order, 
       and pass them to the next operator as soon as they are ready.So PLINQ should not applied for functionalities which depend on a sequence or order

  ->Merge Options in PLINQ:
     ->When a query is executing as parallel.PLinq partitions the source sequence such that multiple threads can work
       on different parts concurrently
     ->If all those separate results are to be consumed on one thread,
       then the results from every thread must be merged back into one sequence
     ->Example:
             from n in nums.AsParallel().WithMergeOptions(ParallelMergeOptions.NotBuffered)
             where n%2==0
             select ExpensiveFunction(n);

  ->ParallelMergeOptions:
            ->NotBuffered: It makes each result return from the parallel threads as soon as it is produced
            ->AutoBuffered: It causes the query to collect elements to a buffer and after everything is processed,it returns the values all at once to the consuming thread
                           ->AutoBuffered may take a longer time than the NotBuffered to make the first element available on the consuming thread    
                           ->periodically yields group by group
            ->FullyBuffered: It yields all the values at once (It is efficient than the above two methods)
