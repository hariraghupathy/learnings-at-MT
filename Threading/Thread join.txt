Thread join:
  
Example:
   ->When we have a list of operations for example a list of mathematical operations 
   ->when a group of threads are dependent on each other , we start the base thread and join it and repeat this for all the threads
   ->so it will execute in order
   ->so what we do is club all the basic operations to a list of threads -> List<thread>
   ->so in a for loop we will join all the threads in the list:
        foreach (Thread thread in workerThreads) 
        {
              thread.Join();
        } 
   ->all the dependent threads are put to a list and joined such that each thread starts and completes execution in a sequential order
   ->then finally we will sum the results from the individual threads and we will display the results
