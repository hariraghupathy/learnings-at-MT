Difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming:

1.Synchronous:
 ->// Example 1 - Synchronous (blocks)
   var result = database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable");
   console.log("Query finished");
   console.log("Next line");

The console.log will wait for the first line to complete execution

2.Asynchronous:
 ->// Example 2 - Asynchronous (doesn't block) 

database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable", function(result) {
    console.log("Query finished");
});
console.log("Next line");

op:1.QueryFinished
     NextLine

op:2.NextLine
     QueryFinished

So long running operations are run inside the async methods

When await is used:
  ->If we define the method as an async method,it should contain the async keyword otherwise the compiler would show an error
  ->It is used to suspend the execution of the method until the awaited task is completed
