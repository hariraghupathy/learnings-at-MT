Extension Methods:  (Extension methods can only be defined in a static class -> very important)
  ->Implementation with an example:
        ->Create a class library with the following two methods
        ->namespace ClassLibrary1
          {
              public class Class1
              {
                 public string Display()
                 {
                    return "i'm in Display method";
                 }

                 public string Print()
                 {
                    return "i'm in Print method";
                 }
              }
          }

        ->Now create a console application in the same solution and add the above class library's dll reference
        ->we will already have a main class named Program in the Console Application
        ->What we have to do is that create a new class which is static 
        ->the new class created which contains the extension method should be static . 

        Code:
 
             namespace ExtensionMethods
             {
 
                public static class XX
                {
                    public static void NewMethod(this ClassLibrary1.Class1 ob)   -> the parameter specified inside the extension method is the most important
                    {
                      Console.WriteLine("Hello I'm extended method"); 
                    }
                }
                class Program
                {
                   static void Main(string[] args)
                   {
                     ClassLibrary1.Class1 obj = new ClassLibrary1.Class1();
                     obj.Display();
                     obj.Print();
                     obj.NewMethod();
                     Console.ReadLine();
                   }
   
                }
             }     


Basically why we need extension methods?
        ->Extension methods allow existing classes to be extended without relying on inheritance
          or having to change the class's source code
        ->Important point to note that if the class is sealed,then there is no point of extending it
        ->So here comes the use of extension methods
        ->overuse of extension methods is not a good style of programming
