Pass Arguments By Value and By Reference:
->Arguments can be passed by two ways
 1.Pass By Value
 2.Pass By Reference

1.Pass By Value:
  ->Most probably we use this method.What the compiler does is it sends the copy of the value instead of sending the 
    value as such.Any modification to the copied value will not affect the original value.

2.Pass By Reference:
  ->Here the address of the variable is passed, and hence any modification to this value will affect the original value also
  ->In c#,we use the "ref" keyword to pass the value by reference

->Out parameter:
  ->in order to assign a value to the called method
  ->the value of the output parameter will be passed by reference
