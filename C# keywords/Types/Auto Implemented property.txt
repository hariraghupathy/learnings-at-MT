Auto implemented Properties:

Public string Name{get;set}

->backing field won't be specified and the compiler will itself implement by internally creating a private field

Normal implemented property:

     public  int EmployeeID
        {
            get
            {
                return _iEmpID;
            }
            set
            {
                _iEmpID = value;
            }
        }

->we create the backing field
